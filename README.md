# Credit-Risk-Analysis
Course project for CS-E5710 - Bayesian Data Analysis D

Author: Hiep Nguyen and Hung Nguyen

The project is part of the Aalto University Bayesian Data Analysis 2022 Course. In this project, we use a hierarchical and a non-hierarchical Bayesian logistic regression model and use the models to identify the riskiness of a loan and classify them into good loan and bad loan.
